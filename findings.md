# What did we find out

Analysis was successful on the first three datasets.

## Sales by Industry

The sales tax reported dataset included NAICS codes, or industry designations.  I created data subsets of 3 industries which are now known to have been impacted during the pandemic:

#### NAICS code 4441 is Building Material and Supplies dealers - for example, Home Depot<br>
![NAICS 4441](subset_4441.png)

#### NAICS code 4453 is Beer, Wine, and Liquor Stores<br>

#### NAICS code 7225 is Restaurants and Other Eating Places<br>
![NAICS 7225](subset_7225.png)

As you can see, the restaurants sales declined, but sales at building materials and beer, wine, and liquor stores increased.

### Calculated tax

For NAICS 4453, the calculated change in tax revenues

## Comparing collected vs distributed

For all industries, the calculated tax for the sales tax year ended February 29, 2020

Distributions of tax to the jurisdictions for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020

Comparing the calculated tax collected to the distributions

The calculated collections versus the distributions are very close!  We must keep in mind that this analysis is somewhat estimated, as there are exemptions, special jurisdictional tax rates, and MTCD tax specifics which aren't taken into full account here.  As they say, this is close enough for government work.

## Employment data

Total Nonfarm type employment, year over year, from 3/1/2019-2/29/2020 to 3/1/2020-2/28/2021

Sales tax collected, by DOL geographical areas, from 3/1/2019-2/29/2020 to 3/1/2020-2/28/2021

Percentage change in employment vs percentage change in sales tax

Although NYC sales tax revenues were significantly impacted over the pandemic year, many other geographical areas were not impacted as strongly.  In fact, many locations actually show an <i>increase</i> in sales tax revenue.

However, the Total Nonfarm employment numbers show significant decreases across all geographical areas.
