Covid shut downs began in NY in March 2020, which was the beginning of the 1st sales tax quarter of the sales tax year 2020-21.

The data from Data 1 only goes through 3Q, 2020-21, or November 2020.  Data was last updated in January 2021, so 4th quarter would theoretically be available in late April 2021.

- Though an industry may not make taxable sales, for the most part, such as a manufacturer who only makes wholesale sales, they may report taxable purchases.
