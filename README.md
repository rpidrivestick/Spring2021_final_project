Sales tax year ends in February
Quarters end: 
- 1 - May
- 2 - August

Final returns for a quarter are generally due by 20 days after the end of the sales tax quarter or year.

Covid shut down began in March 2020, which was the beginning of the 1st sales tax quarter of the sales tax year 2020-21.

The data from Data 1 only goes through 3Q, 2020-21, or November 2020.  Data was last updated in January 2021, so 4th quarter would theoretically be available in late April 2021.

- Though an industry may not make taxable sales, for the most part, such as a manufacturer who only makes wholesale sales, they may report taxable purchases.

Data 2 was last updated in August 2020.
